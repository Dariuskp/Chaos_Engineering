# 💥 Surviving the Storm: Building a Cloud Chaos + Resilience Scorecard with AWS, Terraform, and FIS

## Overview

This project simulates real-world cloud service failures and demonstrates how resilient infrastructure can detect, respond to, and recover from outages automatically. We visualize this using a custom Resilience Scorecard. This is ideal for SREs, cloud architects, and security engineers who want to showcase high availability and chaos readiness.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Simulate cloud failure events (e.g., EC2 shutdowns)
- Build infrastructure with Terraform
- Monitor performance with AWS CloudWatch
- Implement auto-remediation with Lambda (optional)
- Measure resilience with a custom scorecard
